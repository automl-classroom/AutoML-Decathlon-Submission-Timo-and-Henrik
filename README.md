AutoML Decathlon Submission
======================================

The Local test of our code can be executed in automl_decathlon_starter_kit/local_test.ipynb.
The AUP calculation can be seen in automl_decathlon_starter_kit/aup.ipynb. 
Note that performance scores for the AUP have been manually put in the notebook's calculation function.
Our code can be found in automl_decathlon_starter_kit/submission_model.

The requirements.txt is not needed since all libraries are automatically installed during code execution.
